treehouse project 7

This is a Gallery App that displays 24 pictures on a page which were fetched from flickr of the topic of your choosing. 


For the project to work, one needs to add a config.js file with a flickr api key in the src folder.
The file should have this format:


const apiKey = 'your api key';
export default apiKey;
